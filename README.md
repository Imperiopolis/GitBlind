# Git Blind

A tool to help you review an applicant’s github profile with reduced bias.

You can view a live version of this tool at [gitblind.com](http://gitblind.com)

## Usage

This tool is intended to generate a blind view of an applicants GitHub profile. This means you can review their work on GitHub with reduced bias since their username, name, avatar, and other identifying details will be hidden.

We recommend having your recruiter generate a blind link, following the instructions at [gitblind.com](http://gitblind.com). When it comes time for an engineer to screen the applicant, the blind link can be provided so they can review without identifying information.

## Motivation

Git Blind was created by [@Joyable](https://twitter.com/BeJoyable) in order to reduce bias when reviewing applications for engineering roles.
